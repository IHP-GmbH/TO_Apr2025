# DC to 40 GHz Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) Design

This repository contains the design files for a DC to 40 GHz Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) optimized for low input-referred current noise density. The final design achieves ~9.5 pA/√Hz, which is a strong result for a single-ended architecture.

**Features**
* Bandwidth: DC to 40 GHz
* Input-referred current noise density: ~9.5 pA/√Hz
* Single-ended topology
* Designed using open-source tools

**Repository Contents**
