[INFO CTS-0050] Root buffer is sg13g2_buf_2.
[INFO CTS-0051] Sink buffer is sg13g2_buf_4.
[INFO CTS-0052] The following clock buffers will be used for CTS:
                    sg13g2_buf_2
                    sg13g2_buf_4
[INFO CTS-0049] Characterization buffer is sg13g2_buf_4.
[INFO CTS-0007] Net "ascon_top_inst.ascon_permutation.clk" found for clock "clk_25mhz".
