# A Low-Noise Single Ended Linear TIA With 97-GHz Bandwidth

This repository contains the design files for a DC to 97 GHz Single Ended Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) optimized for high linearity and low input-referred current noise density. The final design achieves ~17.3 pA/√Hz, which is a strong result for a single-ended architecture.

**Features**
* Bandwidth: DC to 97 GHz
* Input-referred current noise density: ~17.3 pA/√Hz
* Single-ended topology
* Designed using open-source tools

**Repository Contents**
