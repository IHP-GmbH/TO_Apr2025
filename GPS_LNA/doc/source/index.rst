LNA for GPS
***********

I am currently working with Kagoshima University in Japan on the joint development of a GPS system for rockets. 
Therefore, we designed three types of LNAs to acquire various types of data with the aim of making the GPS system a one-chip system in the future. 
The first design was to design an LNA based on an NPN transistor. 
Second design, because the first circuit is sensitive to inductors, an LNA with an external inductor was designed. 
Third design, the NPN transistor in the second circuit was replaced by a CMOS, and an LNA was designed with the same characteristics. 
These measurements will be used in the design of future one-chip GPS systems for rockets.
