Design Procedure
----------------------------------------------

As shown in the flowchart, the primary focus was to design a state of the art transimpedance amplifier at least in one aspect. 
The bandwidth was chosen as the primary focus thus TIA dB-Ohm and S21 bandwidth were taken into consideration.  
As of this tapeout, literature review shows that the highest bandwidth achieved by a transimpdeance amplifier design was 110 GHz. Other techonologies (e.g. InP, GaAs, etc.) may have higher bandwidth capacity 
so the goal was set to design a DC - 130 GHz TIA  which would be the highest bandwidth in a SiGe process. 
Comparison of the other works can be found in the specification file.
